# PK Framework
Framework created to make life easier for game developers. 
Entirely based on [phaser.io](http://phaser.i/o) html5/js game lib.

>First of all: Sorry for my shitty english...

This is an **organizational framework**. Goals:

- Speed up game production
- Organize and modularize the code

*keep this in mind*

While I do not finish the documentation of this part, see some [examples here](https://github.com/pe77/pkframework-examples).
